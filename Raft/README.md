# Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation

## Project Overview

This project implements the Raft consensus algorithm in Go. Raft is a distributed consensus protocol designed for managing a replicated log. It ensures that all nodes in a distributed system agree on the sequence of log entries in a fault-tolerant way, making it suitable for systems that require high availability and consistency.

## Functionality

The implementation of the Raft protocol features several components crucial for achieving consensus across distributed systems:

- **Leader Election:** Nodes in the network elect a leader for a given term. The leader handles all client requests and log replication.
- **Log Replication:** The leader takes client commands, appends them to its log, and replicates these logs to follower nodes.
- **Safety Mechanism:** Ensures that committed entries are durable and consistently replicated across all nodes.
- **State Machine Application:** Once entries are committed and replicated, they are applied to the state machines on all nodes.

## How It Works

### Initialization
All nodes start as followers. A node converts to a candidate and initiates an election if it doesn't hear from a leader within a randomized timeout.

### Leader Election
Candidates request votes from other nodes. A node will be elected leader if it receives a majority of votes from the cluster.

### Log Replication
The leader accepts client requests, appends them to its log, and subsequently replicates these entries to the follower nodes. Followers append these entries to their logs.

### Committing Entries
Once the leader has replicated a log entry to a majority of nodes, the entry is marked as committed and applied to the state machine.

### Handling Failures
If a leader fails, the followers become candidates after their timeouts expire and a new election process begins.

## Running the Project

To deploy and run the Raft algorithm:

1. Initialize the nodes.
2. Start each node, setting one as the initial leader.
3. Submit commands to the leader node for log replication.
4. Observe the consensus process and log synchronization across nodes.

## Conclusion

This Raft implementation provides a robust framework for managing distributed systems requiring strong consistency and fault tolerance. By using Go, this project leverages efficient concurrency control and networking to ensure that all components communicate and operate seamlessly.
